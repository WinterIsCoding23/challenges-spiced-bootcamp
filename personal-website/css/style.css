/*Continue to build your personal website. Include some of the selectors you learned today. For example:

- create a decorator element with a ::before selector
- style the :link, :visited, :active, :hover state of your links
- use combinators instead of classes if possible: footer ul > li instead of .footer-list-item

❗️ Remember to work with branches and pull requests!

💡 Hint: Styling everything with combinators is equally as bad as styling everything with classes. Try to find a good balance between both.
