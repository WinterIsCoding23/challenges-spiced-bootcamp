# Steps:

1. Declare a variable (type number)
2. Loop through the array.
3. Compare each element of the array.
    - if element is true -> ++
    - if element is false -> nothing
4.

```js
let countSheep = 0;

//loop through the array and for each element.
if (element) {
    countSheep++;
}

return countSheep;
```
