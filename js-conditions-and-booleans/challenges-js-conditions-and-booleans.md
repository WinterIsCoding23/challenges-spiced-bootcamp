## Converting boolean values to strings 🌶️ - 🌶️🌶️

Create a new file name `booleanToString.js`

### Part 1

Declare a variable name `input` and assign a boolean value and a variable name `result`.
Write an if statement, that takes our `input` value and assign to `result` a string `"Yes"` if input is `true`, or a `"No"` if input is `false`.
Console Log `result`

## LogType 🌶️

1. Create a file name `logType.js`.
2. Declare a variable name `data`.

-   "boolean!"
-   "bigint!"

-   "I have no idea!"

## Development

To run the LogType and Converting boolean values to strings challenges, there are two main options:

-   In VS, go to Run -> Run Without Debugging
-   From your terminal. Stand in the folder where the file is. Then run the command `node fileName.js`
